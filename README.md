# 🧰 SpriteGen3D – 3D to 2D Sprite Animation Tool for Unity

`SpriteGen3D` is a Unity editor tool that lets you convert animated 3D models into 2D sprite sheets for use in top-down or isometric 2D games.

It captures your character's animation from **8 directions** — up, down, left, right, and diagonals — and exports **ready-to-use sprite sheets** for each direction. Ideal for RPGs, tactics games, or retro-inspired 2D titles that use 3D asset pipelines.
